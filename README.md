 Project Overview
This project implements a Logistic Regression model using the scikit-learn library to classify data and evaluate its performance. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and achieved a remarkable 98% accuracy on the test data.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy

pandas

scikit-learn (LogisticRegression)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)

ðŸš€ How It Works
Data Loading & Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Training

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
lr = LogisticRegression()
lr.fit(x_train, y_train)
Prediction

python
Copy
Edit
y_pred = lr.predict(x_test)
Evaluation
The model's performance is measured using accuracy, and additional metrics like confusion matrix or classification report (if used).

ðŸ“Š Accuracy Achieved
